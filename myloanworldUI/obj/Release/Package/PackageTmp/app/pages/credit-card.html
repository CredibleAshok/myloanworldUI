        <h1>Credit Card</h1>
        Have you ever heard! Credit card is a hell! But, if you use it wisely it proves to be the best tool in your wallet.
        This allows you to borrow money from a bank to make purchases, whether you’re shopping or paying some bill.
        If you pay back the money you borrow within the “grace period” of 25-30 days, you don’t have to pay extra.
        If you don’t pay it back in that time period, you’ll have to pay interest — a percentage of the money you owe the bank..
